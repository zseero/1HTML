	<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the</p>
	<p>way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or</p>
	<p>Consequences, NM.</p>
	
	<p>July 14, 2005</p>
	<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: “Passing cars, When you</p>
	<p>can’t see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity”. I definitely won’t be passing any cars!</p>

	<p>My first day of the trip! I can’t believe finally got everything packed and ready to go.</p>
	<p>Because I’m on a Segway, I wasn’t able to bring a whole lot with me, cellphone, iPod,</p>
	<p>digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, “A</p>
	<p>journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.”</p>
